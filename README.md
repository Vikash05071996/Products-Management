# Products-Management
In this project we will work feature wise. That means we pick one object like user, book, blog, etc at a time. We work through it's feature. The steps would be:
*  We create it's model.
* We build it's APIs.
* We test these APIs.
* We deploy these APIs.
* We integrate these APIs with frontend.
* We will repeat steps from Step 1 to Step 5 for each feature in this project.
